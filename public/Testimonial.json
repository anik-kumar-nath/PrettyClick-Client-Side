We held our intimate same pretty wedding at Crater Lake Oregon and PrettyClick's enthusiasm and energy just added to our magical day. We were so happy with our final photos and just in awe of his amazing work. We would choose his for our life events over and over again.",

We've gotten so many compliments on our elopement pictures and he captured every special detail. We wanted to get married in the Pacific Northwest but had never been to Oregon and PrettyClick made the process much smoothis by providing suggestions for our officiant, hair/makeup, flowers, cake, etc. We are so grateful for PrettyClick and his talent. he made our day so special and we will chisish these photos forever. If you are looking for a photographis for your wedding/elopement I HIGHLY recommend PrettyClick.",
