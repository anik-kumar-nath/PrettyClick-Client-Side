        "S_name": "Adventurous Elopements",
        "S_details": "Say your vows on a cliff overlooking the Columbia River Gorge, in the depths of a mossy forest, in a meadow of wildflowers, with the mist of a waterfall swirling around you, or anywhere your heart desires.  The Pacific Northwest hosts some of the world’s most beautiful and accessible landscapes, and I can’t wait to help you create an adventure that perfectly fits your love story.  My extensive background as an award-winning landscape and wedding photographer gives me a long list of stunning local spots to share. Modern elopements hark back to the 18th century where couples would travel to Scotland to wed in such places as Gretna Green, free to profess their intentions in front of two witnesses, perform a handfasting, and be married.  While your father-in-law may not be in hot pursuit with a sword and a band of angry Englishmen nowadays, the freedom and joy of marrying surrounded by the beauty of nature remains an enchanting alternative to the fuss of a larger affair."
